PART 1 & 3
==========

We chose to implement high scores instead of networking for Part 3, as neither of us had created a Pong game initially.

High scores are updated and saved when the player wins the game.


The controls for Breakout are:

(PC)
Arrow Keys - Move
Space - Start the game
P - Pause/Unpause (High Scores are displayed while paused)
R - Restart

(Gamepad)
Left Thumbstick - Move
A - Start the game
Start - Pause/Unpause
Y - Restart


PART 2
======

The functionalities implemented for Part 2 are best found in the Easy Maze, but a more dramatic effect is seen in the more difficult mazes.

The controls for the Maze Game are:

(PC)
WASD - Move
Mouse - Look around
Z - Toggle Day/Night
X - Toggle Fog
G - Toggle collisions
Q - Toggle music
Home - Return to start of maze

(Gamepad)
Left Thumbstick - Move
Right Thumbstick - Look around
Left Bumper - Toggle Day/Night
Right Bumper - Toggle Fog
Y - Toggle collisions
X - Toggle music
Start - Return to start of maze
